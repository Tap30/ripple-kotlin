# Contributing to Ripple Kotlin SDK

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Ripple Kotlin SDK as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We'll use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Tap30/ripple-kotlin/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Tap30/ripple-kotlin/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install JDK 17 or higher
3. Run `./gradlew build` to build the project
4. Run `./gradlew test` to run tests

## Code Style

- Use Kotlin coding conventions
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
